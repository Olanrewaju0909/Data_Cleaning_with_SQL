# Data_Cleaning_with_SQL

## Business Objectives
The primary objective of the "Data_Cleaning_with_SQL" project is to enhance the quality and integrity of the provided data, aligning it with the rigorous standards set forth by our organization. This data-cleaning initiative is pivotal in ensuring that our analytics and decision-making processes are based on accurate, reliable, and consistent data.


## Data Cleaning
I embarked on this data-cleaning endeavor with the dataset titled "employee_mod." The data in its raw form exhibited various discrepancies, such as missing values, inconsistent formats, and erroneous entries. My meticulous data-cleaning procedures addressed these issues systematically, resulting in a refined dataset that adheres to our quality standards.


## Data Transformation
As part of the data cleaning process, I implemented a series of data transformations to enrich the dataset and prepare it for subsequent analytical tasks. Several key tables were created to structure the data effectively:

t_departments: This table provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's departments, facilitating efficient data categorization and analysis.

t_dept_emp: An essential table that links employees to their respective departments, allowing us to examine workforce distribution and allocations.

t_dept_manager: This table offers insights into departmental management by detailing the managerial relationships within the organization.

t_employees: A critical table that captures essential employee information, serving as a foundation for various HR-related analyses.

t_salaries: This table compiles data on employee salaries, enabling comprehensive compensation analysis.


## Data Visualization
Our progress in data cleaning and transformation was visually presented through the MySQL Workbench dashboard, which is available as an attachment to this repository. This dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to explore the dataset's cleaned and transformed aspects, providing an intuitive means to interact with the data.

In summary, the "Data_Cleaning_with_SQL" project has successfully achieved its objectives of enhancing data quality, enabling effective data analysis, and ensuring that our data aligns with the stringent standards upheld by our organization. I encourage you to explore the attached MySQL Workbench dashboard to gain valuable insights from the refined dataset.
